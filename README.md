## Distinguish images of dogs from cats
<br />This classic image classification project with 25,000 images of cats and dogs is very interesting to play with.
<br />
<br />When doing this project, I was able to get myself more familiar with **TensorFlow** as well as **Keras**. Also, I practiced my skills in terms of general techniques with **Transfer Learning** using **ResNet50** under CNN architecture which has been proven many times to be able to achieve high accuracy in performance.
<br />
<br />Also, I have attached a bunch of reflections by doing this project at the end of the code as comment. Feel free to check them out if you are interested in. 😃
